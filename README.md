## Challenges and What I learned
- I converted the basic 3X3 tic-tac-toe to a dynamic one. So based on user input it will create 4X4 / 5X5 or any size.
- How to create a dynamic grid and making it clickable.
- Displaying the player sign on the grid.
- Showing the status of the game (win / draw / who won / whose turn it is)
- How to restart the entire game for the same martix size.
- Dynamic two dimentional array handling and interactions with DOM.
